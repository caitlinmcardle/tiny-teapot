        At Tiny Teapot we want to create beautful looking websites that are easy
        to interact with and will help your business grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand how important a website is to your business, so we won't
        bombard you with technical language and will work closely with you each
        step of the way. You can provide as much or as little input as you would
        like, and we can cater to businesses of any size and budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        We love tea (if you hadn't already guessed) and would be happy to put
        the kettle on and have a chat with you (either remotely or in person).
